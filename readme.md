## CSS Integration / 2 Exercises ##

# Integral 1 is an exercise to learn cards and responsiveness #
-In this exercise I used grid for the cards.
-Flexbox to make the website responsive since grid did not seem to work.

# Integral 2 is an exercise to learn tables and text editing and charts.#
-I used tables to make order.It is important to create a space with a space breaker otherwise it was not possible.
-To create charts was a print screen so next time take a look at it.

PS: Take a look at the trick from Manuele for the chart exercise to create identical designs.
